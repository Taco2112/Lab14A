The 80-Point version requires implementing each one of the four concrete Shape classes.
A constructor is not needed, nor are there any data attributes.
This version completes each individual concrete class by implementing the drawShape method only.
The geometric shapes are roughly drawn in the center of each  cell as the output display shows below.
The testing program needs to create an array of Shape objects and use this array to display each object.
